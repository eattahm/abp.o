<h3 id="what-is-personal-data">What is personal data?</h3>
<p>The purpose of data protection is to protect personal data. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>This information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also nicknames and information in your forum posts.</p>
<h3 id="collection-and-processing-of-personal-data">Collection and processing of personal data</h3>
<p>When using our websites, as AdblockPlus.org and AdblockBrowser.org (Websites), we automatically collect the following data in order to provide you with our services, and for security reasons:</p>
<h4>Automatically collected information</h4>
<h5>Website logs</h5>
<p>All requests to our website are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address (solely for the purpose of IT security and only accessible by eyeo's IT Security team), the time at which the request was made, the web address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page. This data (IP address only aggregated via hashing with a daily changing salt) is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain. Everything else is deleted.</p>
<h5>Data retention</h5>
<p>The request to our website, including your IP address, is stored when you create a forum post, submit a contact form, or add a blog comment. This allows administrators to effectively address spam content and security breaches. All stored requests are deleted after 30 days.</p>
<h5>Google Analytics</h5>
<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service from Google Inc. ("Google"), on our Websites. Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies" (text files stored on your computer that enable us to analyze your use of our Websites). Information generated by the cookies (including your abbreviated IP address) is transmitted to and stored at a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information to assess your use of our Websites, to compile activity reports, and to provide more services connected with the use of our Websites. It is possible that Google may transmit this information to third parties if required by law, or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google.</p>

<h4>Purpose of data collection and processing</h4>
<p>In compliance with Art. 5 (b) <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, we collect and process your personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and do not further process your data in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
<p>We collect and process your personal data, such as website logs and data relating to subscription downloads, extension update checks (such data is collected and processed by Google, see<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">  Google Privacy Policy</a>), emergency notifications and Issue Reporter data sent by you, for technical purposes. We mainly collect and process such data to prevent security attacks and are thus able to provide our services to you in a secure and data-efficient manner.</p>
<h4>Legal basis of data collection and processing</h4>
<p>We collect and process your personal data in compliance with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and the applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws and German national data protection laws.</p>
<h4>Collection and processing is based on your consent - Art. 6 (1) a <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, Art. 4 (11) <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>
<p>We will always ask for your consent to collect and process your personal data for the aforementioned specific purposes, unless the collection and processing of your personal data is permitted by statutory laws. Where you have provided us with your consent to the collection and processing of your personal data for the aforementioned specific purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<h4>Collection and processing is necessary for taking steps prior to enter into a contract - Art. 6 (1) b <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>
<p>The collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you may be a party. Prior to entering into such a contract, the collection and processing of your personal data may also be necessary in order to take steps at your request. This applies for installation (data gathered by the browser and / or app store) and the use of our products.</p>
<h4>Collection and processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject -- Art. 6 (1) c <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>
<p>Collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws or the laws of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State.</p>
<h4>Collection and processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests - Art. 6 (1) f <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>
<p>The collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We collect and process website logs for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, preventing denial of service attacks. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Preventing such overloads of our systems and any security issues by denial of service attacks is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use the website logs. We use information collected and processed via subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications and feedback data sent by you, for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, ensuring the security of the extension version used by you. Ensuring the security of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data. Furthermore, we collect and process such data to ensure that our website and extension are constantly improved and adjusted to the changing requirements for an efficient usability and the technical environment. Ensuring the usability of our websites and of our products is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-disclose-any-personal-data">Do we disclose any personal data?</h3>

<ul>
<li>If required for legal proceedings / investigations, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties. We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and / or abusive behavior. We are also legally obliged to give certain public authorities information. These are criminal investigation authorities, public authorities which prosecute administrative offences entailing fines and the German finance authorities.</li>
<li>As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of eyeo GmbH changes. The legal structure may be adapted, subsidiaries, business units or components may be created, bought or sold. In such transactions user information may be shared with the transmitted part of the company. In the event of a transfer of personal information eyeo GmbH will ensure that it is done in accordance to this privacy policy and the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws and German data protection laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not transfer your personal data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance. We will ask for your prior permission unless the transfer of such data is permitted by <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> or any other applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws and German national data protection laws.</p>
